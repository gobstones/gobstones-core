/**
 * This module provides mechanisms to support basic localization of strings.
 * This allows for error messages and CLI to support different languages
 * without much effort.
 *
 * Note that this module does not provide localization for the Gobstones Language
 * but for a tool internally, and should not be confused with other classes
 * exposed by this package. If you want to learn about how to translate the
 * Gobstones Language see
 * [The Gobstones Language Translation Module](https://gobstones.github.io/gobstones-lang-intl).
